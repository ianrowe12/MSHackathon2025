### Sample AI Chat Interaction

**User:** "How can I improve my opening?"

**Enhanced AI Response:**
> "As a **Confident Professional** at the intermediate level, your opening confidence is at 80% - which is strong! However, I noticed your emotional arc shows 'building confidence' pattern, meaning you get stronger as you go.
> 
> **Specific advice for your archetype:**
> 1. Since you're analytical by nature, try starting with a compelling statistic
> 2. Practice your first 30 seconds until it's muscle memory  
> 3. Use power poses before presenting to boost initial confidence
>
