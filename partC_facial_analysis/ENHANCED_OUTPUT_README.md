## Enhanced AI Feedback Generation

### For Chat Interface
The expanded output enables the AI to generate much more personalized and actionable feedback:

#### Before (Basic):
> "Good presentation. Consider smiling more and maintaining eye contact."

#### After (Enhanced):
> "You demonstrate the **confident_professional** archetype with strong baseline skills! Your eye contact is exceptional at 82.5% and you maintain consistent confidence throughout. 
> 
> **Your emotional arc shows 'consistently_strong' patterns** - opening confidence of 80%, peak energy of 90% mid-presentation, and strong closing impact of 88%. This indicates excellent preparation and natural presentation ability.
>
> **Specific Development Areas:**
> - Increase smile frequency from 35% to 45% during lighter content

> - Practice expression variety to match emotional tone of content
>

## Sample Usage in Chat Interface

```javascript
// In your chat interface, you can now generate much richer responses:
const generateFeedback = (insights) => {
  const archetype = insights.coaching_insights.speaker_archetype;
  const stage = insights.coaching_insights.development_stage;
  const arc = insights.visual_sentiment.emotional_patterns.emotional_arc;
  
  return `Based on your ${archetype} presentation style and ${stage} skill level,
